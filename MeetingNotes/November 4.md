# Meeting notes for {11-4-19}

Alex, Chris, Michael, Kerwin, Amir, and Ahmad met to discuss the comcast meeting last friday and where we were at.

The meeting that would be this Friday has been canceled. We talked about how we could find more vulnerable packages for injections based in javascript. Once we add more classifications, dowloading these packages and automatically running the sink finder on them will need to be scripted. Once automated the output will be easy to read and can get more statistics. That script is started, it just needs to be adapted to run our current tools on the database. 

We then talked about the graphs of the sink finder on the package versions and discussed why the sink finder was missing false -s. We also mentioned strengthening the tool to find the false -s and work out false +s. The remaining Level 2s were brought up and should be finished off so we can close off this loose end. 

### New Deliverables for Next Meeting (11-6-19)

- Looking into false negatives to strengthen the finder (Michael)
- Finish off Level 2s (Alex)
- Automate FTT with package dowloading script (Chris & Kerwin)
- Work on vulnerability classification (lots of code injection in CWE-200?) (Chris & Kerwin)
