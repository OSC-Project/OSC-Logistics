# Meeting notes for {8-2-19}
Everyone met at 1100 to review the slide for the Comcast meeting. They were edited and polished to include the false and true positives and some leads to follow up on. Ahmad showed an example of the embedded chai being exploited and how the newer version doesn't contain the exploit. 

At 1300 we met, but the Comcast meeting had been cancelled. Amir and Laurent discussed the wacky example we found:  `obj[F+U].call(data)`, and what to work on for next meeting.

### New Deliverables for Next Meeting (8-5-19 @ 1500 hrs)
- Find how common `].call(` and `].apply(` are in the packages (Alex)
- Follow up on the leads and try exploiting them (Alex)
