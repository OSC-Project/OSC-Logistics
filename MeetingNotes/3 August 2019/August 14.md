# Meeting notes for {8-14-19}

Alex, Chris, and Laurent met to discuss their progress on the exploitable demos. Chris walked everyone through the assert.operator demo. Alex had a similar demo for his evalScripts. Both are working. A little more realistic example for each would be nice. Both need to start their write ups and email them tonight. They will be added in to the slides for the Comcast meeting on Friday.

### New Deliverables for Next Meeting (8-15-19 @ 1430 hrs)
- Write ups for each vulnerability (Alex/Chris) (tonight)
