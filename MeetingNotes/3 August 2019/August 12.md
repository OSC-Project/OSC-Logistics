# Meeting notes for {8-12-19}

Laurent, Ahmad and Alex met to update our progress. Alex had an issue setting up Jupyter, but showed the work on the markdown file. He will fix it up and add to the notebook after the meeting. He also added a section about the grep results versus the tool's results.

The payloads weren't correct, so after looking up examples of each package, they will be  looked into to see if they can be exploited. After that, the notebook will be updated with how it was or was not exploitable.

Comcast meeting is this Friday. We will meet again tomorrow to make sure we are on track.


### New Deliverables for Next Meeting (8-13-19 @ 1430 hrs)
- Finish setting up Jupyter and add the markdown to the notebook (Alex)
- Find examples of the packages and make a payload example (Alex/Chris)
