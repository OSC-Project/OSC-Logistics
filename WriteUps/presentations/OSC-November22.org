* Tool Findings

*** How to improve *Sink Finder* ?
0. Look at literature for dangerous language primitives and their semantics
1. Use examples of vulnerable code from literature on CVE/CWE
2. Extract a database of code exploits (CVE) from public DBs
3. Use the DB to validate *Sink Finder*
4. For each CVE /not found/
   - Identify the code change when CVE fixed
   - Guide developer to recognize a /new/ pattern
   - Upgrade *Sink Finder* with /new/ pattern
   - Validate new version (regression)

*** COMMENT Details (1)
**** Angular
- It calls a put/get/pull method, wouldn't be able to inject anything
  here (predetermined values, anything else wouldn't make sense)
**** Backbone
- Level 4ish, predetermined values. Could not inject our own method.
*** COMMENT Details (2)
**** Director
- ~Router.prototype.invoke()~ seemed exploitable...
  - But it is not a top level api!
- Tried and wasn't able to invoke any malicious functions (exploded)
*** COMMENT Details (3)
**** Router
- never executes arguments, always ran on an empty array.
- (Predetermined values for what the methods would be)
**** Flot
- ~Executehooks~ seemed exploitable...
  + But the data being passed was always sanitized and/or pre-determined (exploded)



* Analysis Pipeline Process

*** Download and Extract CVE Sources
- Working version completed
- Downloads & extracts relevant source releases per CVE
- Categorizes them by reported state (safe, vulnerable, etc.) and CWE
  - Before
  - Current
  - After

*** Run Finder on Sources
- Working version completed
- Runs existing finder on downloaded sources
- Ongoing improvement as part of workflow

*** Analyze Finder Output
**** Still in development
- Take finder output and compare sink findings of CVE package across versions
- Sink present at line ~X~ in last vulnerable version, same sink missing in first safe version...
- Point out to developer where sinks are being *detected/disappear*
- Also create file difference between versions for easy analysis of these areas

     :END:
- Red: CVEs that have been looked through
- Orange: CVEs that aggregate multiple vulnerabilities
- Blue: Others

*** Recalling the Purpose of the Tool Extension
- Verify that the Sink Finder tool is reliable in finding other documented vulnerabilities.
- Make the manual testing process an automated one.
- Track the progression of sinks across repository versions.
- Higher volume of test cases.
- Facilitates easier tool modification.

* Tool Extension Improvement

*** Obtaining data
1. Harvested information from multiple data source
   - Circl
   - NIST
   - SourceClear
2. Collected packages in their vulnerable and nonvulnerable builds

*** Process procedure: Data Gathering Platform
- Obtain package data by running our created scrubbers for different online DB.
- include various different builds and installatation information.


*** Process procedure: Testing Platform
- Reads data generated from the Data Gathering Platform
- Download source of the Package (and unpack)
- Runs the Sink Finder
- Validates Sink Finder results & logs results into DB


*** Testing Platform Update
- Downloads CVE from our internal Database.
- Execute the sink finder on these CVE entries
- Compare logs on different versions
  - before vulnerability reported (last safe)
  - during vulnerability life cycle (unsafe)
  - after vulnerability is fixed (newly safe)


*** Package Analysis
Of the packages that were obtained, we would like to focus on
- Postgres
- pouchdb
- Syntax-error
- Shell-quote
- summit
**** Rationale


*** Package: postgres
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: shrink=10
:END:
[[file:postgres.pdf]]

*** Package: pouchdb
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: shrink=10
:END:
[[file:pouchdb.pdf]]

*** Package: syntax-error
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: shrink=10
:END:
[[file:pouchdb.pdf]]

*** Package: shell-quote
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: shrink=10
:END:
[[file:shell-quote.pdf]]

*** Package: summit
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_opt: shrink=10
:END:
[[file:summit.pdf]]

*** The Next Steps
- Analyze the results of the testing Platform
- See diffs between versions in our CVE entries
- Make statistics of the tools performance
- Recognize new patterns of vulnerable code constructions.
**** Findings : Two candidates
- ~JSON.parse~
- ~this.constructor.constructor~ (in safeEval)
