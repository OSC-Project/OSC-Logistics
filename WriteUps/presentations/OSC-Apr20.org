* CVE Classification
*** Last Time
- Generated frequency distributions over 34 injection CVE
- Manually decided relevant terms via ranking by highest frequency
- Scored relevancy of rest of database by occurence of these terms
[[./figures/stem.png]]

*** Results From Last Time
- Many entries scored highly, suggesting relevant terms were not specific enough
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 9cm
[[./figures/freq_res.png]]

*** Refining Search Method
- Determined set of distinquishing terms.
- Distinguishing terms = Common in sample, uncommon in random sample
- Results seem near identical to manually identified terms
[[./figures/monogram-distinguished-frequency.png]]

*** Refining Search Method cont.
- Same process was used to find frequency distribution of bigrams from relevant CVE summaries
[[./figures/bigram-sample-frequency.png]]

*** Bigram Occurence Analysis Results
- Less CVEs were found, but found to have more relavance
- [[./figures/bigram-analysis-results.png]]

*** Example: CVE-2018-3772
- Entered in Database as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
- While true, this vulnerability can lead to a Command Injection attack, as mentioned in description:
- "Concatenating unsanitized user input in the `whereis` npm module < 0.4.1 allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The `whereis` module is deprecated and it is recommended to use the `which` npm module instead."

*** Moving Forward
 - Bigram Analysis seems more precise, but yeilds fewer results.
 - Continue manual analysis of high scoring CVEs from monogram (one-word term) analysis.
 - Weighting for distiguishing terms.


* LGTM
*** Where We Left Off
 - There were issues with getting LGTM to Work
 - We have been working on the CodeQL CLI
    - Issues regarding processing Metadata and .yml files to compile our queries through the CLI
*** What's New
- Metadata and .yml issues have now been resolved.
- CodeQL CLI is running
  - For our Custom queries
  - predefined queries from Semmle
- We have results from our queries that suggest CodeQL can find our sinks
*** The Query we primarily used
- The query searches for a variable declaration with the call expression eval.
[[./figures/Apr20_Queryused.PNG]]
*** Result format
- Column A: Query name
- Column B: description of Query
- Column C: problem type
- Column D: message attached to query
- Column E: Location
- Column F: Starting Line Number
- Column G: Starting column Number
- Column H: Ending Line Number
- Column I: Ending column Number
*** CodeQL query Results
 [[./figures/csvQueriesResult.PNG]]
 - We are able to locate sinks using CodeQL.
*** CodeQl Results Continuation
- Here are the lines in the files corresponding to the results
*** CodeQl results as shown in the files
[[./figures/VisualSinksV2.png]]
*** What is next for LGTM/CodeQL
- Expand with understanding closure rules of CodeQL
- Diversify with more queries for Code Injection
- Continue to analyze the other packages we used the sink finder on
- Consider possible automation of this process.


* OSC Benchmark

*** Where We Left Off
- Build a JavaScript benchmark library with synthetic examples to mimic OWASP's benchmarks
- Tests are either a true or false positive
- Currently 9 benchmarks:
    - 5 created from our testing over SQL injections, JS injections, and OS cmd injection
    - 2 created from relevant CVEs for variant analysis
    - 2 from code obfuscations we've previously discovered

*** What's New
- Script for automatically generating scorecard
    - Based off tool's results for a given in a csv file
    - Breaks down the tool's true/false positive and false negative rate for any cwe
-OWASP's scorecard
    [[./figures/OWASP_Card.png]]
-Our scorecard
    [[./figures/TEST_Card.png]]

*** Interpreting scorecards
- Quick reference on how to use scorecard results
[[./figures/benchmark_guide.png]]

*** Future Work
- Updating score card script to integrate the tool (LGTM) to run over benchmarks and generate score card automatically

* CVE-ID Registration
*** CVE-ID Registration
- Learned the process for submitting a CVE-ID request
- For most vulnerabilties, contact the appropriate CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) and give appropriate info:
 - Usually need vulnerability type, a description, impact, and affected products (including version)
- If a CNA is not listed for a particular software, fill out request form on CVE website
*** Registering What We Have Found
- Collected data necessary to make CVE-ID requests for the following packages:
 - Jade
 - Depot
 - PrototypeJS
- CNA for all three packages is Nodejs
*** Vulnerability Information
- Jade: Command line expects a file name as input. However, if javascript is provided and not a file,
	then fs.readfileSync will catch and evaluate the javascript given as input.
 - Vulnerability type: Server side JS injection
 - Affected product: Jade version 1.11.0
 - Impact: Code Execution
- Depot: code can be injected directly into input box succeeding a semicolon.
 - Vulnerability type: Server Side JS Injection
 - Affected product: Depot v0.1.6
 - Impact: Code Execution
- PrototypeJS: improper use of eval() is used in a way that leaves the application vulnerable to injection attacks
 - two vulnerabiltiies, one server side and one client side
 - Vulnerability type: Server and Client side JS Injection
 - Affected product: Prototype version 0.0.5
 - Impact: Code Execution

* Summary
*** What We Have Done So Far
- Use Bigram analysis along with manual analysis in highest scoring cves
- Got the CLI for LGTM to work and using custom queries
- Created a scorescard to assess tool's reliability
- Submited the vulnerabilties we had found as CVEs
*** Questions?
- Questions and Comments?
