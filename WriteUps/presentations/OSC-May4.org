* CVE Classification
*** Last Time
- Generated frequency distributions over 34 injection CVE
- Manually decided relevant terms via ranking by highest frequency
- Scored relevancy of rest of database by occurence of these terms

*** Results From Last Time
- Many entries scored highly, suggesting relevant terms were not specific enough
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
[[./figures/freq_res.png]]

*** Refining Search Method
- Determined set of distinquishing terms.
- Distinguishing terms = Common in sample, uncommon in random sample
- Results seem near identical to manually identified terms
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
[[./figures/monogram-distinguished-frequency.png]]

*** Refining Search Method cont'd.
- Same process was used to find frequency distribution of bi-grams from
  relevant CVE summaries
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6cm
[[./figures/bigram-sample-frequency.png]]

*** Bigram Occurence Analysis Results
- Less CVEs were found, but found to have more relevance
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[./figures/bigram-analysis-results.png]]

*** Example: CVE-2018-3772
- Entered in Database as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
- While true, this vulnerability can lead to a Command Injection attack, as mentioned in description:
- "Concatenating unsanitized user input in the `whereis` npm module <
  0.4.1 allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The
  `whereis` module is deprecated and it is recommended to use the
  `which` npm module instead."

*** Next Step
 - Bigram Analysis seems more precise, but yeilds fewer results.
 - Continue manual analysis of high scoring CVEs from monogram (one-word term) analysis.
 - Weighting for distiguishing terms.


* LGTM
*** Where We Left Off
 - There were issues with getting LGTM to Work
 - We have been working on the CodeQL CLI
    - Issues regarding processing Metadata and .ql pack files to compile our queries through the CLI
*** What's New
- Metadata and .yml issues have now been resolved.
- CodeQL CLI is running
  - For our Custom queries
  - predefined queries from Semmle
- We have results from our queries that suggest CodeQL can find our sinks
*** The Query we primarily used
- The query searches for a variable declaration with the call expression eval.

*** Result Details
[[./figures/VisualSinksV2.png]]
*** What is next...
- Expand with understanding closure rules of CodeQL
- Expand set of queries for Code Injection
- Analyze the other packages we used the sink finder on
- Consider possible automation of this process.


* OSC Benchmark

*** Where We Left Off
- Build a JavaScript benchmark library with synthetic examples to mimic OWASP's benchmarks
- Tests are either a true or false positive
- Currently 9 benchmarks:
- Automatically generates scorecards


*** What's New
- Working with Kerwin on the LGTM script
  - Will run our custom quieres on a target directory


*** Next Step
- Integrating LGTM driver script to use the scorecard generation script

* CVE-ID Registration
*** Where We Left Off
- Emailed cve-request@iojs.org
- Submitted info requesting CVE-IDs for Jade, Depot, and PrototypeJS packages

*** What's New
- Continuing the process for submitting a CVE-ID request
- Was told to upload information to HackerOne website
- Made 3 reports on HackerOne for each package (Jade, Depot, and PrototypeJS)
- Now waiting for another response

* Summary
*** What We Have Done So Far
- Use Bigram analysis along with manual analysis in highest scoring cves
- Got the CLI for LGTM to work and using custom queries
- Created a scorescard to assess tool's reliability
- Submited the vulnerabilties we had found as CVEs
*** Questions?
- Questions and Comments?
