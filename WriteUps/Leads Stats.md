* Angular - It calls a put/get/pull method, wouldn't be able to inject anything here (predetermined values, anything else wouldn't make sense)
*  Backbone - Level 4ish, predetermined values. Could not inject our own method
*  Director - Router.prototype.invoke() seemed exploitable, but it isn't a top level api. I tried and wasn't able to invoke any malicious functions (exploded)
*  Router- never executes arguments, always ran on an empty array. (Predetermined values for what the methods would be)
* Flot - Executehooks seemed exploitable, but the data being passed was always sanitized and/or predetermined (exploded)
