## FileName1.js
What this file does. You can make it as long or short as you need. 

```
// Make sure you include comments
var http = require('http');
// A decent amount
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello Node.js World!');
}).listen(8080);
```

## FileName2.js
What this file does. You can make it as long or short as you need. 

```
// Make sure the http library is loaded
var http = require('http');
// Create an http server
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    // Lambda that defines how the http server reacts to <input
    // Responds with 200 in header
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    // And a hello world page
    res.end('Hello Node.js World!');
}).listen(8080);
```
